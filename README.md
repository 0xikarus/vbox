# vmbox

Persistent remote boxes, controlled by a provider-agnostic CLI and a mandatory
controller. Use an interactive terminal or submit a one-shot command. The optional
lightweight web UI only configures resources; work happens through the CLI.

## Install and connect

Go 1.26 or Docker builds the CLI. OpenSSH is required for native attachment.
No Railway, Docker or Incus client/token is needed for ordinary CLI operations.

```bash
./install.sh
vmbox context add team --controller https://YOUR-CONTROLLER
# Supply VMBOX_CONTROLLER_TOKEN through secure environment configuration.
vmbox ls --json
vmbox helper1
```

Controller login does not provision SSH credentials. Configure an SSH agent or
`VMBOX_SSH_IDENTITY_FILE`; native attachment requires the account owner role.
For an existing worker that has not enabled native sessions, run
`vmbox sessions helper1 --enable` once. This stages the matching runtime without
restarting worker compute or replacing existing sessions.

## Interactive mode

```bash
vmbox helper1                    # choose Codex, Claude, shell, or an existing session
vmbox helper1 codex              # start interactive Codex without the picker
vmbox helper1 claude             # start interactive Claude without the picker
vmbox helper1 shell              # start a plain persistent shell
vmbox sessions helper1 --json
vmbox helper1 --session NAME     # attach to this exact existing session
```

The picker defaults to the box's configured agent. Each explicit agent override
starts a **new** tmux session; use `--session` to reconnect without creating one.
Agents are optional: a box can contain shells and multiple agent sessions at once.
Normal `claude` and `codex` commands keep their interactive interfaces and menus.
You can run other installed tools, including OpenCode, from a shell.

Detach with **Ctrl-a, then d**, and choose **Keep running** at the CLI exit prompt.
Disconnecting keeps the worker and tmux processes running. Persistent interactive
sessions prevent one-shot tasks from automatically hibernating their box.
`vmbox hibernate helper1` is a separate explicit action: it saves workspace state,
stops live processes, and retains the disk. Restoration is not process survival.

## One-shot mode

```bash
vmbox task helper1 codex --prompt "Fix the failing tests and verify the change" --json
vmbox task helper1 claude --prompt "Review the code and summarize your findings" --json
vmbox task helper1 shell --prompt "make test" --json

vmbox task-status helper1 TASK_ID
vmbox task-output helper1 TASK_ID
vmbox task-status helper1         # list one-shot tasks
```

The controller queues the command, allocates/restores the box if necessary, and
runs it in `/data/workspace`: `codex exec`, `claude -p`, or `bash -lc`. Existing
agent authentication, model and permission settings are retained. Codex permits
a workspace outside a Git repository using `--skip-git-repo-check`. There is no
automatic update-menu handling or interactive screen parsing in this path.

The agent tracks the progress and meaning of the work in its prompt. vmbox only
tracks **process execution**, including start/finish timestamps, the actual exit
code, and combined stdout/stderr:

- `exited` with exit code `0`: the process succeeded—not independent proof that
  the agent completed the requested work correctly.
- `exited` with a nonzero code: the exact process failure code is retained.
- Signal termination records the signal separately, with a null exit code.
- `launch_failed` or `unknown`: no fabricated exit code. Connection loss does not
  imply completion, and ambiguous execution is never automatically replayed.

Output/status commands return JSON without waking compute. The first 1 MiB of
combined output is retained on the worker and copied into controller storage;
truncation is explicitly reported. Running output is a periodically collected
snapshot, not a guaranteed live stream. Task results contain command output, so
avoid printing credentials in your commands. Results persist until their logical
box is deleted; deleting its volume/logical box also removes task history.

After exit, including nonzero exit, the controller automatically hibernates only
when there are no pending/unknown tasks, legacy active tasks, or live tmux sessions.
Automatic preparation refuses other live workspace processes instead of killing
them. Results are stored before releasing compute. Interactive siblings stay up.

For safe submission retries, supply the same `--idempotency-key KEY`; conflicting
reuse is rejected. `--session NAME` optionally names the one-shot tmux session,
which normally disappears when the process ends. Use task-output for retained
output. `--agent AGENT` remains an alias for the positional agent argument.
OpenCode one-shot execution is not implemented. Old API `/tasks` clients retain
their interactive behavior; new CLI one-shot tasks use `/process-tasks`.

`vmbox updates helper1 --json` separately reports changes in **live tmux snapshots**,
not task completion. It does not replace `task-status` or `task-output`.

## Controller administration

```bash
vmbox providers schema
vmbox providers create railway primary --config-file railway.json --secret-env PROVIDER_SECRET_JSON
vmbox providers default railway primary
vmbox providers update railway primary --config-file image-edit.json --json
vmbox boxes update helper1 --default-agent codex
vmbox fleet slots set 2
```

Provider secrets stay encrypted on the controller; public reads never return
them. Updates are revision-protected and preserve omitted secrets. Retargeting
or deleting provider aliases requires explicit resource migration.
Standalone mode, provider-specific client contexts and web terminal sharing are
removed. Existing resources, credentials and legacy local bundles are preserved.

[controller operations](docs/CONTROLLER.md), and [OpenAPI](docs/openapi.yaml).

## Build and verification

```bash
go build ./cmd/vmbox
go build ./cmd/vmbox-controller
go test ./...
go vet ./...
npm run test:browser
bash tests/run.sh
```

Native tests use a real isolated tmux/PTY when available. Database integration
requires `VMBOX_TEST_DATABASE_URL` pointing at disposable PostgreSQL. Browser
tests cover configuration, not real mobile keyboards or production agent replies.
Worker images remain controller/operator infrastructure; the installer ships
neither a standalone deployment bundle nor provider tooling.

The two-mode rollout was tested with real Claude/Codex responses, shell exit codes
0/7, independent worker output comparisons, and persistent interactive sessions.
Idle-hibernation guards were tested with real local tmux and disposable PostgreSQL.
A full live Railway allocate → execute → auto-hibernate test still needs an unused
disposable slot; the existing occupied boxes were intentionally preserved.
